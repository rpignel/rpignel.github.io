I am a MSc student in Finance and Strategy at Sciences Po Paris. At the same time, I will follow a MRes in applied economics in 2022-2024 to complete my academic career and to further my interests. My research interests are in Financial economics, applied macroeconomics and structural econometrics.

This site aims to publish my personal work (papers, essays, research). And also to discuss the research project I wish to pursue, by publishing the different steps of this work.
